# FileSorter-FormApp-

"Im busy show me your code!"...
[here you go.](/FileSorter_FormApp/Form1.cs)

What does my app do?
- You select a folder that you want to sort
- FileSorter asks you how you want it organized; by day, month, year?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It lets you ignore subfolders in your selected folder
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It lets you ignore files that you dont want to sort individually.
- FileSorter then creates folders and copies or moves your files into those new, well organized folders.

I created FileSorter with massive Pictures folders in mind.<br>
However FileSorter will work to sort Documents as well, and most other file types.

Example:

My images folders are always a mess, note the span of dates taken...
![Alt Test Dir Before](/Images/testDirBefore.PNG "Test Dir Before")

![Alt FileSorter GUI](/Images/fileSorterAfterSubmit.PNG "FileSorter GUI")

Now my Test folder images are sorted by month!
![Alt FileSorter GUI](/Images/testDirAfter.PNG "FileSorter GUI")
